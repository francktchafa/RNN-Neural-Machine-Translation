**Neural Machine Translation**

A project that uses Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for date format conversion. Using the attention mechanism,
it translates human-readable dates in various formats (e.g., "25th of June, 2009" "03/30/1968" and more)
into standardized machine-readable formats like YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., "2009-06-25").
